# Mathematical and Data Modelling 1 (MDM1) - Report 3

## Modelling the growth of Douglas Fir

This was the second group project of my MDM1 module. During the time of writing this report, we were learning about differential equations.

### Goal
We were organised into another random group and assigned this prompt:

>Trees play a key role in regulating the Earth’s climate and environment. They are an important part of
Earth’s ecosystem and provide humans with timber and fuel. Propose a differential equation to
describe the height of a tree as it grows. Take into account that tree’s metabolism and growth depend
on the leaf area and that trees cannot grow indefinitely. Integrate the equation numerically and
analyse the properties of its solutions as the problem’s relevant parameters vary. 

The goals of this project were to:
- Create a model using one or more differential equation.
- Give an interpretation to the various parameters you introduce in your model.
- Analyse the model.
- Characterise the behaviour of the model for different values of the relevant parameters.

### Target Audience
The report should be accessible to a scientifically literate person with no particular expertise in the topic we researched.

### Report and Feedback
The final report can be found [here](MDM1%20REP3.pdf) and the feedback given can be found [here](MDM1%20REP3%20Feedback.pdf)

### Compiling
The report can be compiled using `latexmk`.
`main.tex` is found in the `Latex` folder.
